# 01 ‚Äì What is a Smart Contract?

> üìò **Objective**: Learn what a smart contract is, why it's important, and what it can do.

## üß† What Is a Smart Contract?

A **smart contract** is a program that runs on the blockchain. It defines a set of **rules and behaviors**, and once deployed, it executes automatically when conditions are met.

> ‚úÖ Think of it like an unchangeable robot agreement that lives on the blockchain.

### ‚ú® Key Features:

| Feature      | Description                                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| üîí Immutable | Once deployed, code cannot be changed.                   |
| üîç Transparent | Anyone can read and verify the logic.                  |
| ‚öôÔ∏è Autonomous | Automatically executes without intermediaries.          |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Real-World Example vs Smart Contract

| Scenario       | Traditional Way                          | Smart Contract Way                      |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Voting         | Manual paper ballots, counted by people  | Call `vote()` function on a contract    |
| Rent Payment   | Bank transfer + manual confirmation      | Call `payRent()` ‚Üí funds sent instantly |
| Ownership      | Government land registry                 | `ownerOf(propertyId)` on-chain forever  |
| Digital Rights | Copyright registration or platforms      | NFT ownership recorded on-chain         |

## üíº What Can Smart Contracts Do?

Smart contracts are the backbone of Web3 and can be used for:

- üí∏ Automating payments (e.g. salaries, rewards)
- üé® Managing NFTs and digital ownership
- üè¶ Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols
- üó≥ DAO voting and governance
- üéÆ Blockchain games (e.g. item trading, upgrades)

## üí¨ What Language Do They Use?

Smart contracts on Ethereum are written in:

### üî§ Solidity
- High-level, statically-typed language inspired by JavaScript
- Compiles to bytecode for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
- The primary language used in this course

## ‚úÖ Quiz: Check Your Understanding

> Select the best answer for each question.

**1. What makes smart contracts "immutable"?**  
- [ ] They are encrypted with SHA256  
- [x] Once deployed, the code cannot be changed  
- [ ] Only admins can change them with a private key  
- [ ] They use zero-knowledge proofs

---

**2. Which of the following is NOT a typical smart contract application?**

- [ ] AWS Cloud  
- [x] Blockchain virtual machine (e.g. EVM)  
- [ ] GitHub servers

---

**4. Why is transparency important in smart contracts?**
