## LESSON 4: REMIX FUND ME

#### Learning Objectives
- Understand how Ethereum transactions interact with smart contracts.
- Define and use payable functions to accept Ether.
- Apply require statements to enforce rules and handle reverts safely.
- Analyze gas consumption and understand the impact of reverts on gas usage.
- Explain the Oracle Problem and the limitations of on-chain data access.
- Understand how Chainlink solves the Oracle Problem using decentralized oracles.
- Use Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to generate secure, tamper-proof randomness.
- Utilize interfaces and imports to interact with external contracts.
- Apply type casting to ensure safety and prevent vulnerabilities.
- Define and use mapping to store key-value data.
- Create and work with struct to group related data.
- Understand how to use library functions to modularize logic.
- Use for loops for iteration in Solidity.
- Implement a constructor for initial contract setup.
- Use modifier functions to control access and reduce repetitive code.
- Understand and apply the unchecked keyword for gas optimization (with caution).
