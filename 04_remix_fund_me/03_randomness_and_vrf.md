### Randomness in Blockchain

As mentioned earlier, blockchain systems are deterministic by nature. . This makes it inherently difficult to generate random numbers in a secure and verifiable way. To solve this, Chainlink provides a **Verifiable Random Function (VRF)**.

Chainlink VRF allows smart contracts to securely generate random numbers on-chain. This is useful for applications such as gaming, NFTs, and lottery systems. To learn more and start using it, visit the official [Chainlink VRF documentation.](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2-5/getting-started)
